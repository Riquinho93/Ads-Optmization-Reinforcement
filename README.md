# Ads Optmization Reinforcement

Reinforcement learning is part of the machine learning that train reward mechanisms
and punishment. The main objective is to take the best action or path possible to get the most
reward and minimal punishment through choice in a specific situation.

In this study, I reviewed the article "Reinforcement Learning: The Concept Behind UCB Explained With Code"
and apply the concepts to an ad optimization database I found on Kaggle.

The main subject for using the UCB which focuses on two concepts: exploration and
explotation. 

- exploration: gives equal chances of choice for all actions, regardless of their
average reward. Even stocks with the lowest average rewards chosen will be chosen.

- explotation: is a technique that will always be looking to repeat the action that has already
presented the best result, being the one with the greatest reward, remembering
that we don't know which action gives the highest average reward of all possible.

## Tool used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Math
- Python
